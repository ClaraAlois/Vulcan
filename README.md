**Vulcan** is a multi-purpose discord bot build with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) created to administrate the discord server of our group of friends. This bot has been made in collaboration with [this man](https://github.com/CarlosGomes98).
  
This repository is currently **under-development**.
_All of the code present is subject to change_.

## Documentation

Currently there is no documentation.

## Application Structure

Currently in a volatile state. Details will be posted once consensus has been reached.

## Installation

Currently there are no installation wizards. Manual installation is necessary by following these steps:

1. Download and install node.js.
2. Download and extract the zip repository code.
3. Open a shell in the directory of the extraced code.
4. Run the following command: **npm install && npm start**

(closing the shell window will result in the bot shutting down)
